# 3rd year course paper

This repository contains a part of all code files which were used to obtain the results for my course paper. Basically, some of this code contains the realization of some concepts from the Chernozhukov et al. paper ([link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.04802.pdf)), and some code represents the realization of my ideas about the methods (ways of hyperparameter tuning) which could improve the modelling.
